# Countdown Timer

## Intent
This program counts down from `10` to `1`, allowing the user to stop it by typing `"stop"`.

## Pseudo-code
1. Initialize a countdown variable at `10`.
2. Start a `while` loop that continues until the count reaches `0`.
3. Print the current countdown number.
4. Ask the user if they want to stop the countdown.
5. If the user enters `"stop"`, break the loop.
6. Otherwise, decrement the count and continue.
