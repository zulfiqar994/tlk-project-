# Guess the Number

## Intent
This program generates a random number between `1` and `10` and asks the user to guess it using a `while` loop until they guess correctly.

## Pseudo-code
1. Generate a random number between `1` and `10`.
2. Start a loop that continues until the user guesses correctly.
3. Prompt the user for a guess.
4. If the guess is correct, print "Correct!" and exit the loop.
5. If the guess is incorrect, prompt the user to try again.
