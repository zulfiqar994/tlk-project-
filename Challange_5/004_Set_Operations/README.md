# Challenge 4: Set Operations

## Intent:
Learn how to perform union, intersection, and difference operations on sets.

## Pseudocode:
1. Create two sets.
2. Use `.union()` to combine both.
3. Use `.intersection()` to find common elements.
4. Use `.difference()` to find elements in set1 but not in set2.
