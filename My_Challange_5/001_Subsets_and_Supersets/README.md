# Challenge 6: Subsets and Supersets

## Intent:
Practice checking relationships between sets using `.issubset()` and `.issuperset()` methods.

## Pseudocode:
1. Create `set_a` and `set_b`.
2. Check if `set_b` is a subset of `set_a`.
3. Check if `set_a` is a superset of `set_b`.
4. Print both results.
