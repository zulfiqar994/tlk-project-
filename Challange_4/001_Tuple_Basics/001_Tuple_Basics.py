# Challenge 1: Tuple Basics
# Program by: Zulfiqar Ahmadi
# Date: March 26, 2025
# Purpose: Demonstrating basic operations with tuples

# Creating a tuple with different data types
data_tuple = (42, 3.14, 'Python', True, (1, 2, 3))

# 1. Print the entire tuple
print("Full Tuple:", data_tuple)

# 2. Access and print the third element
print("Third Element:", data_tuple[2])

# 3. Extract the nested tuple and print its first element
nested_tuple = data_tuple[4]
print("First Element of Nested Tuple:", nested_tuple[0])
