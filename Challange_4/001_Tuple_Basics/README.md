## README.md - Challenge 1: Tuple Basics

### Purpose
This program demonstrates basic operations with tuples by performing the following tasks:
- Printing an entire tuple containing mixed data types.
- Accessing and printing the third element from the tuple.
- Extracting and printing the first element of a nested tuple.

### Pseudo Code
1. Create a tuple with various data types.
2. Print the entire tuple.
3. Access and print the third element using its index.
4. Extract the nested tuple using indexing and print its first element.

### Example Output
```
Full Tuple: (42, 3.14, 'Python', True, (1, 2, 3))
Third Element: Python
First Element of Nested Tuple: 1
```
